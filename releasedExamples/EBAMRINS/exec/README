This is an application to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations in complex geometries.  
In the input file you might want change 
#number of steps
max_step  	      = 1000
#time
max_time              = 100.0

#viscosity  of the fluid
viscosity             = 1.0
#maximum amr level number
max_level	      = 0


#number of cells at the coarsest level
n_cell                =  128 64 64

#what the geometry is.  See src/AMRINSUtils.cpp for options.
